PLC-Gnosis (Working Title)
==========================

This software is the GUI for an experimental power line communication module built around the ns-3 network simulator.

Overview
--------

The purpose of this software is to abstract away the difficult and time-consuming process of hand-piecing together power line communication network models from scratch in c++ using the ns-3 simulator. 

The GUI provides most of the tools necessary to graphically represent the available network components and provides an intuitive interface for adjusting model parameters, cable types, noise sources and others. Also built by this package is a library through which models created in the GUI can be loaded into hand-crafted simulation code. This allows for extreme flexibility in both method and purpose when using the ns-3 plc module to model power line communication networks.
